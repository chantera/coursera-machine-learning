# coursera-machine-learning

This is my work on [Coursera Machine Learning class](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/), which is taught by Andrew Ng (Associate Professor, Stanford University; Chief Scientist, Baidu; Chairman and Co-founder, Coursera). I took this class between April and July, 2016. These assignments were done in MATLAB and all of these passed. My overall grade was 95.3% including quizes.
